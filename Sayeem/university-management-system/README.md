# University Management System ‚Äì Task 2.1

This is a Java project implementing **Task 2.1** of the course **TIES4560: SOA and Cloud Computing**.  
The goal of this task is to design and implement a **custom SOAP Web API** and integrate it with a Jetty-based server.

---

## üìå What Has Been Implemented
As part of **Task 2.1 ‚Äì Web Service with Web API**, I have:

- Designed and implemented a **custom SOAP Web API**.  
- Created two SOAP services:
  - **ProfileService** ‚Üí for managing student profiles.  
  - **DocumentService** ‚Üí for managing student documents and permits.  
- Implemented the **SOAPServicePublisher** to publish custom SOAP services.  
- Integrated the **Jetty Web Server** to handle API calls and enable interaction with the SOAP services.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Services

### 1. Publish the SOAP Services
Run the following class to publish the custom SOAP services:

src/main/java/fi/jyu/ties4560/soap/publisher/SOAPServicePublisher.java


---

### 2. Start the Jetty Server
Run the Jetty server to enable API calls:

src/main/java/fi/jyu/ties4560/server/UniversityWebServer.java

---

### 3. Test with Postman
Once the server is running:

- Use **GET** and **POST** requests to create and retrieve student profiles.  
- Use the API endpoints to test failure cases (missing fields, invalid IDs, etc.).

## üìë API Endpoints

### ProfileService
| SOAP Service Method | Path        | Method | Parameters | Response | Failures |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| GetProfile           | /api/profile | GET    | `studentId` (query param) | JSON with profile info and `200 OK` | `400` (missing ID), `404` (not found), `500` (error) |
| CreateProfile        | /api/profile | POST   | JSON body: `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `program`, `yearOfStudy`, `nationality` | `201 Created` with `studentId` | `400` (missing fields), `500` (error) |
| UpdateProfile        | /api/profile | PUT    | JSON body with `studentId` and fields to update | `200 OK` with success message | `400` (missing ID), `404` (not found), `500` (error) |

---

### DocumentService
| SOAP Service Method | Path          | Method | Parameters | Response | Failures |
|----------------------|---------------|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| CheckPermit          | /api/document | GET    | `studentId` (query param) | JSON with permit status and urgency flags | `400` (missing ID), `404` (not found), `500` (error) |
| UpdatePermit         | /api/document | PUT    | JSON body with `studentId`, `expiryDate` | `200 OK` with success message | `400` (invalid/missing fields), `404` (not found), `500` (error) |

## ‚úÖ Summary
This project demonstrates the use of **SOAP Web Services** and **Jetty Servlets** to implement a university management system. It showcases how to design custom APIs, integrate SOAP-based services, and test them with Postman.
